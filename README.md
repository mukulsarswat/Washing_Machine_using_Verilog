# Automatic Washing Machine Controller Using Verilog

## Overview
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) to control an automatic washing machine. The design simulates the operation of a washing machine through states such as checking the door, filling water, adding detergent, washing, draining, and spinning. The project includes a comprehensive testbench to verify the FSM's behavior under various scenarios, with waveform generation for debugging.
- For this project we are using **Mealy Model**.

  - Time unit: 10 ns (10,000 ps), precision: 1 ps.

## State Diagram
The state diagram visually represents the **finite state machine (FSM)** controlling the washing machine. Each state corresponds to a **specific phase** in the washing process, and **transitions occur** based on **input signals and conditions**. By examining the diagram, one can easily understand the flow of operations and the logic behind each transition.

### `top_tb`
- **Purpose**: Tests the `automatic_washing_machine` module under various scenarios.
- **Features**:
  - Generates a VCD file (`dump.vcd`) for waveform viewing.
  - Monitors internal state (`current_state`) and all inputs/outputs.
  - Tests multiple scenarios, including normal operation, error cases, and edge cases.
- **Test Cases**:
  1. **Normal Operation with Rinse and Delays**: Full cycle with rinse, `done = 1` at 1,350,000 ps (135 units).
  2. **Start Without Door Closed**: Stays in `CHECK_DOOR` until `door_close = 1` at 1,750,000 ps (175 units).
  3. **Detergent Not Added**: Stalls in `ADD_DETERGENT` from 2,600,000 ps to 2,800,000 ps.
  4. **Incomplete Fill**: Stalls in `FILL_WATER` from 3,400,000 ps to 3,600,000 ps.
  5. **Premature Cycle Timeout**: Early `cycle_timeout` at 4,550,000 ps.
  6. **Reset in CYCLE State**: Reset at 5,200,000 ps, returns to `CHECK_DOOR`.
  7. **Reset in DRAIN_WATER State**: Reset at 6,350,000 ps, returns to `CHECK_DOOR`.
  8. **Multiple Cycles**: Two consecutive cycles, `done = 1` at 8,250,000 ps and 9,150,000 ps.

## Waveform
The following is a reference waveform generated from the `top_tb` testbench using Siemens QuestaSim on EDA Playground. It shows the behavior of all signals and the internal state (`current_state`) across the test cases.

## Analyze Waveforms
   - Verify key events:
     - **Test Case 1**: `done = 1` at 1,350,000 ps (135 units).
     - **Test Case 2**: `current_state = 000` until `door_close = 1` at 1,750,000 ps (175 units).
     - **Test Case 3**: `current_state = 010` from 2,600,000 ps to 2,800,000 ps.
     - **Test Case 4**: `current_state = 001` from 3,400,000 ps to 3,600,000 ps.
     - **Test Case 5**: Early `cycle_timeout` at 4,550,000 ps, transitions to `DRAIN_WATER`.
     - **Test Case 6**: Reset at 5,200,000 ps, `current_state = 000`.
     - **Test Case 7**: Reset at 6,350,000 ps, `current_state = 000`.
     - **Test Case 8**: `done = 1` at 8,250,000 ps and 9,150,000 ps.
   - Use EPWaveâ€™s time axis (set to ps) to zoom into specific events.

## Usage
- Clone or download this repository.
- Open EDA Playground via the provided [link](https://edaplayground.com/x/p57_) or upload the Verilog files.
- Follow the simulation steps above to run and analyze the testbench.
- Use the waveform viewer to debug state transitions and output behavior.

## Notes
- The design assumes a 10 ns clock period (5 ns high, 5 ns low).
- The testbench is designed to be comprehensive, covering normal operation, error conditions (e.g., door open, no detergent), and edge cases (e.g., premature timeout, resets).
- For further customization, modify the testbench delays or add new test cases in `top_tb`.
